# WikipediaSpeedrun
 This repo uses the Wikipedia API to make a game where you must get from one topic to another using each pages links

 Currently this repo only has a basic console application version of the game.
 Later goals include:
  * making the application look nicer in console and improving the UI
  * replacing the inputed start and end with a random two preselected pages
  * adding a saved high score functionality using a matrix
  * creating a running graph of the links of all the pages the user inputs
